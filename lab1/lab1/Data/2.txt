solve the multi-object tracking problem by using a single uncalibrated moving camera; ii) handle complex scenes where multiple pedestrians are moving at the same time and occluding each other; iii) estimate the 2D/3D temporal trajectories within the camera reference system.

The key contribution of our work relies on the fact that we simultaneously estimate the camera parameters (such as focal length and camera pose) and track objects (such as pedestrians) as they move in the scene. Tracks provide cues for estimating camera parameters by using their scale and velocity in the image plane; at the same time, camera parameters can help track objects more robustly as critical prior information becomes available. This, in turn, allows us to estimate object 3D trajectories in the camera reference system. We utilize a simplified camera model

In this project, we aim to solve a challenging problem of multi-target tracking under unknown camera motion. To meet the most general condition of tracking applications, we did not rely on the use of stereo-camera and SfM algorithm. To cope with the unknown camera motion as well as frequent occlusion between targets, the targets were tracked in the 3D coordinate and the camera's parameters are estimated in a joint fashion. Specifically, our goals are to: i) solve the multi-object tracking problem by using a single uncalibrated moving camera; ii) handle complex scenes where multiple pedestrians are moving at the same time and occluding each other; iii) estimate the 2D/3D temporal trajectories within the camera reference system.
